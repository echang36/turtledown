 of Washington I yield myself the balance of the time  Madam Chairman let me just comment on a few points here that were made by my friends on the other side of the aisle There was some concern about the timing of the hearing and the people who were invited  I just want to make this point when the hearing was held we have to have advance notice We had witnesses coming in from across the country so we are going to have the hearing on the day we said because of the expense incurred by those private citizens who wanted to come here and testify to help protect private water rights  The second point is this was a bipartisan bill as my colleague from Colorado Mr Polis admitted He was an original cosponsor of the bill Maybe that was a reason why my friends on the other side of the aisle did not call a witness for or against the original legislation  I just wanted to make that point The hearing was scheduled and it had to go through because of the expense of the private citizens coming in to testify  I want to make another point too that some of my colleagues have made Several of them have said that this legislation redefines Federal water rights  Madam Chairman that is simply not true If they read the bill they would see that the definition is for the purpose of this act only meaning that the definition is only for this act so that doesnt hold up either  Just about all of my colleagues on the other side that talked about the Federal lands and so forthI will acknowledge that this is about Federal activity on Federal lands but nowherenowhere did my colleagues suggest or say that the Federal Government had the water rights  Why Because that is states rights and as my colleague from Wyoming said Yes it is Federal land but it is State water and you have to mesh those together  And finallyI think this is probably more important than anything else and frankly a debate like this has been going on for some time                              time  1530  We agreewe agree both sidesthat ski resorts have been potentially compromised by the threat of the Federal Government saying no permit unless you give up water Both sides agree on that The question is What is the remedy  The big difference I think between the two sides is this Their remedy is well the rulemaking isnt over Lets find out what the rulemaking is and then we will respond to it Our side takes a different approach Our side says wait a minute We are the House of Representatives We are part of the Congress We make the law  That is what this legislation does It makes the law saying the Federal Government cannot extort through the permitting process State water rights It is as simple as that And so if we are going to continue to have the debate in this House on divisions between the two parties and what their philosophy is frankly I welcome this because it appears every time we have a debate similar to this their side says let the bureaucracy write the laws We say wait a minute That is not the way it is supposed to be We are the Congress We write the laws That is what this debate is about here today and I look forward to the amendment process  In the meantime I urge my colleagues to support this legislation It has been characterized as a Western piece of legislation but as Mr Woodall says indeed it is not It affects all water rights which are the province of the States  It is good legislation and I yield back the balance of my time
