 Mr Speaker I rise today to applaud President Barack Obama for signing the Presidential proclamation recognizing March 2014 as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month  I would also like to give a special thanks to the 146 Members of Congress who signed onto the letter I authored and sent to the President requesting the issuance of this proclamation  Finally but more importantly thank you to the colorectal cancer community who have given their time sweat and tears to raise awareness about prevention and early detection Our efforts have not gone unnoticed  This month the highest office in the land the President of the United States brought national attention to our fight  What better way to pay tribute by remembering those who have lost their battles to colon cancer such as my late father the honorable Congressman Donald Payne Sr who I followed into Congress who lost his battle with cancer 2 years ago today  This proclamation honors his memory and it honors those who are fighting the battle against colon cancer today
