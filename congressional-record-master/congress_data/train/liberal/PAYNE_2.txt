 Mr Speaker with the deadline to sign up for the Affordable Care Act approaching I want to encourage everyone especially young people and people in my district to sign up for health insurance  For those who think the process is too cumbersome or you wont get an affordable rate listen to this story from a 29yearold woman from New Jersey Fawziah Qadir She said My employer agreed to provide 300 a month towards any health plan I could find  Unfortunately trying to find an affordable insurance plan on her own in New Jersey where she lives she said was insane One quote was over 700 others provided flimsy coverage  Full of frustration Fawziahs mother told her about the health care insurance marketplace She says that when she logged onto healthcaregov she was surprised to find out how easy it was to enroll  With her employers contribution she has a comprehensive plan that costs just 63 a month That is less than a cell phone bill or a cable bill and we are talking about something much more importantour Nations health  Dont wait Go to healthcaregov and find a plan that works for you
