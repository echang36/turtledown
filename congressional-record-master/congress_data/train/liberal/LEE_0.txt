 of California Mr Speaker I rise today to join my colleagues in calling for a vote on comprehensive immigration reform We have bipartisan legislation that has the support of the American people and the votes needed to pass the House  Our system has been broken for far too long In my own district there are heartwrenching stories of families who came here for a chance at the American Dream only to have been torn apart and separated  Not only is comprehensive immigration reform morally right it is the right thing to do for our economy Also the Congressional Budget Office this week found that passing HR 15 would reduce the deficit by 900 billion over the next two decades The economic benefits are clear  Now is the time to pass a fair immigration plan which provides a pathway to citizenship reunites families and helps grow our economy The Senate passed immigration reform last year Now the House must act We have the votes Lets do it now
