 of Washington Madam Chairman I yield myself such time as I may consume  President Obama has made no secret of the fact that he is willing to act unilaterally to impose new laws and regulations on the American people declaring that he has a pen and a phone  Over the last 5 years there have been numerous examples of what has become an Imperial Presidency Under the administration the reach of the Federal Government has extended into nearly every sector of our economy and ensnarled it in new red tape and regulations  An egregious example of this is the Federal Governments concerted effort to take water away from individuals and businesses Water is the lifeblood of communities and essential for a strong economy Cities ranchers farmers businesses along with the jobsPage H2386they support all depend on a stable supply of water to survive  For over a century there have been established laws upholding a States right to manage its water and its water laws but now this administration is threatening to undermine those laws and seeks to take away private property rightsor private water rights governed under State laws  Madam Chairman that is why we are here today to consider HR 3189 the Water Rights Protection Act This bipartisan bill would protect private property rights from Federal overreach that threatens to take water supplies away from water users such as ski areas ranchers cities towns and local conservation efforts  This bill is responding to a very real threat as the Obama administration has sought to extort water from individuals and businesses through the permitting process  Now how is this done Madam Chairman Federal agencies are threatening to withhold permits needed to operate on Federal lands unless private water rights are turned over to the Federal Government  Put more simply the Federal Government is holding necessary permits hostage unless water rights are relinquished and they are demanding that water rights be signed over without payment which of course is a violation of the Constitutions guarantee of just compensation  Unfortunately these businesses that are affected need both the permits and the water in order to operate so what the Federal Government is doing is forcing them into an impossible situation where either choice puts them in danger of losing their livelihood or their businesses                              time  1430  During todays debate we will hear specific examples of businesses and families including ski resorts and ranchers who have experienced this heavyhanded tactic of the Federal Governments  It is important to be clear about the risk posed by the Federal Governments action This is not simply a threat to ski resorts and to ski areas located on Federal land as I am sure some will argue on the floor here today The known problem is much greater We have heard testimony in our committee to that fact and the threat is not limited to one part of the country  If a Federal agency can demand that a ski resort in Vail or that a rancher in Utah has to hand over his water to get a Federal permit then a Federal agency can certainly do the same thing in other StatesOhio Florida West Virginia Water may be more plentiful in these regions of the country than in the arid West but the Federal Governments appetite has no geographical limits when it comes to expanding its regulatory control and its disrespect for private property and the livelihoods of American citizens This is a threat being felt first by the West but the risk is real and it exists for the entire country  Madam Chairman regardless of where the Federal Government seeks to take water and from whom it is trying to take it it is simply wrong and it must be stopped That is why HR 3189 is necessary and it is why the bill is endorsed by numerous national and regional groups including the US Chamber of Commerce the National Ski Areas Association the American Farm Bureau Federation the National Cattlemens Association the Natural Water Resources Association and others  Now in the course of the debate there will be claims and assertions made today that this bill is overly broad and that it will have a whole range of unintended consequences Madam Chairman I certainly dont blame those who support the Federal takings of private water rights from wanting to change the subject but this bill is very focused It has only one consequence and that consequence is absolutely intended It stops the Federal Government from taking the water of American citizens without paying for it It does nothing else  In fact this bill carefully states that this prohibition will not affect irrigation water contracts FERC licensing endangered species recovery national parks or any other legal authorities Important environmental restoration wildlife protection and conservation work that has been occurring for years in a positive cooperative mannerand that is whether it is in Puget Sound which is in my State in the Chesapeake Bay nearby here or in the Florida Evergladeswill all continue and all are protected Such efforts will not be changed by this legislation  Madam Chairman I want to thank and recognize the sponsor of this legislation our colleague from Colorado Mr Tipton for all of his hard work in advancing this important commonsense bipartisan legislation  It is time for the legislative branch to exert itself on behalf of the American people and rein in the imperial overreach of the executive branch and this administration No law gives Federal agencies the authority to take private property rights as the administration is seeking to do In fact the Constitution prohibits such takings It is time to put an end to such tactics so I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and send a strong signal to this administrationto leave private property rights alone  I reserve the balance of my time
