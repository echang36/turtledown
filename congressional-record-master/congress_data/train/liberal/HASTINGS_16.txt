 of Washington Madam Chairman I yield myself the balance of the time  I have to say the debate on the underlying bill in this amendment I find rather interestingno maybe bizarre is better than that  The issue here is whether we should protect the States responsibility to write water law or allow the Federal Government to extort from private individuals that water That is what the issue is all about here  He had bipartisan support when the bill was heard in committee but then it changed for some reason Now we have in front of us the Polis amendment which would very narrowly put this protection only to ski areas and not to everybody else that has private property rights  The consequences if this were to become lawwhich it is not going to I am convinced with this amendmentbut the effect of this would be this okay Ski areas are protected this year Next year it will be a rancher that is abused so we will come back and we will write a law to protect the rancher  Next it will be a water conservation district someplace that will be affected because of the directive so we will come back and fix that Then it will be some municipality someplace that will be affected because they dont have water rights because it was extorted by the Federal Government so we will have a fix for that  Madam Chairman there is a better way to do that Lets just simply respect states rights to regulate water law and to codify that with this language  Finally just let me make this observation The effect of adopting this as I mentioned in my opening statement as it relates to tribal rights what this amendment really does more than anything else is it puts ski resorts water rights above tribal rights That is really what the adoption of this amendment does  So I would say that the underlying bill is a bill that is the responsibility of us as the legislative branch in this Congress It deserves our support This amendment does nothing to advance that at all and should be defeated  I urge my colleagues to vote no and I yield back the balance of my time
