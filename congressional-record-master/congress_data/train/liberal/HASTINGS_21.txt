 of Washington Mr Chairman I yield myself such time as I may consume  It is wellknown the Obama administration has waged a longrunning war on coal which last year a White House adviser admitted is exactly whats needed but this is not only a war on coal It is a war on jobs our economy affordable energy small businesses and the household budgets of American families Already faced with higher home heating costs middle class families will be further squeezed if the Obama administration is successful in its attempts to shut down coal production  One of the ways the administration has carried out this war on coal is through the reckless rewrite of a coal production regulation the 2008 Stream Buffer Zone Rule Shortly after taking office the Obama administration discarded the 2008 rule that went through 5 years of extensive public comment and environmental review Since then the administration has spent over 10 million taxpayer dollars in working to rewrite this rule including hiring new contractors then only to dismiss those same contractors once it was publicly revealed that the administrations proposed rewrite would cost 7000 jobs and cause economic harm in 22 States A report released by our House Natural Resources Committee staff in September of 2012 following years of oversight and investigations exposed the gross mismanagement of the rulemaking process potential political interference and widespread economic harm the proposed regulation would cause  Earlier this year the US Department of the Interiors Office of Inspector General or IG released a report with similar findings However what is more troubling is that the IG has identified significant ongoing problems with the rulemaking process To make matters worse they are refusing to disclose those problems to us here in Congress For example there is an entire section of the report that we have received entitled Issues with the New Contract that have been almost completely blacked out Despite our repeated requests Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall has refused to give Congress an unredacted copy of this report In a letter she states that the Department of the Interior decided that it should be withheld from the committee  The IG is charged with being an independent watchdog for Congress It is completely unacceptable and inappropriate for the IG to be taking orders from the Interior Department especially about what information to withhold from us here in Congress  Mr Chairman I dont take what I am going to say lightly That is why today I have issued a subpoena to the Departments Inspector General Kendall for this information that she has withheld from us If the IG discovered ongoing issues with the way the Department is currently conducting this rulemaking process they have a responsibility and a duty to share that information with Congress now The committee is not asking the IG for materials produced by the Department but we are asking for materials and interviews produced by the IGs staff  The Obama administrations rulemaking process has been and continues to be an unmitigated disaster Despite having spent millions of taxpayer dollars they have absolutely nothing to show for it and to date havent even produced a draft Meanwhile States industry and Americas coal miners are left in limbo unsure of what the operating rules are on the ground Without the 2008 rule we are left with a rule that was put in place in 1983  That is why we are here todayto consider HR 2824 the Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America Act This legislation will put an end to the years of ongoing waste and dysfunction It will put in place a responsible process to ensure there is no rush to recklessly regulate  First Mr Chairman it stops the administrations unnecessary rewrite and implements the 2008 Stream Buffer Zone Rule that I mentioned took 5 years to put in place It then directs the Department to responsibly study the impact of the rule for a prescribed period of time prior to initiating another new rule This will provide certainty to the economy to the individual States and allow a clear examination of what may be needed and changed in the future This bill will make certain that a new rule is written properly  Now some will attempt to criticize this bill for the fact that it puts in place the 2008 rule that was vacated on a very narrow technical ground by a Federal judge last month There is really nothing new here however because this is the exact outcome that the administration has been seeking for over 5 yearsto get rid of the 2008 rule But lets be clear what the court ruling and subsequently the Departments actions really mean  The court ruling strikes down the more protective 2008 rule and sets us back 30 years to a less restrictive 1983 rule The 2008 rule is more modern and more protective in limiting the impacts of coal mining than the 1983 rule but one Federal judge ruled that the 2008 rule must be set aside due to a narrow procedural technicality This judge ruled because the 2008 rule didnt have formal consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service on possible impacts to endangered species the entire rulePage H2622should be set aside and thus revert back to the 1983 rule  Mr Chairman for the record there were multiple meetings and discussions and consultations with Fish and Wildlife in proposing the 2008 rule regarding species when the 2008 rule was written and it was done in a published and transparent fashion over a multipleyear period Comments were taken and recommendations were made but the bureaucratic process wasnt done precisely so and as a result this judge struck it down Compare this conscientious effort which was done to protect species in the 2008 rule with the fact that there was absolutely zero consultation of protecting species in the 1983 rule  What could be the responsible thing to do Clearly it would be to implement the more modern and protective 2008 rule What does the Obama administration say It says lets go back to 1983 Why should we go back It simply makes no sense to discard a modern rule where we know the ESA consultation took place for a 30yearold rule that we know had no ESA consultations  Perhaps we should look to the people whom the Obama administration hired to write a rule of its own In case notes that the committee obtained from the IGs office during their investigation it quotes one of the current contractors admitting The 1983 rule was less restrictive than the 2008 rule In the same case notes it also states about the current contractor that although she is a Democrat the Stream Protection Rule appears to be an effort to kill coal mining There you have itstraight from the mouth of the person who is working on the current rewritean admission that the new rule is an effort to kill coal mining  That is why we must take action today to stop this administration Not only are they attempting to impose a new coal regulation that will destroy thousands of American mining jobs but they have also wasted 5 years and over 10 million taxpayer dollars on a process that has been completely dysfunctional and misguided  Enough is enough Republicans want to create an America that works and that requires access to affordable energy If we do not stop the administration from implementing its new coal regulation thousands of Americans will be out of work and home heating costs for working middle class families will rise  Lets pass this legislation to protect American taxpayer dollars to protect American jobs and to end this administrations reckless wasteful rewrite by putting in place a responsible process that will allow a proper new rule to be written  With that I reserve the balance of my time
