 of Washington Mr Chairman I yield myself such time as I may consume  Mr Chairman President Obama has not been shy about his willingness or his desire to circumvent Congress and take unilateral action on a variety of issues This lack of shyness includes the designation of new national monuments  In fact during the Presidents first term in office an internal memo was leaked that showed plans to potentially lock up more than 13 million acres of Western land with the simple stroke of the Presidents pen  Major land use decisions such as this should not be made behind closed doors and should fully involve the local citizens whose livelihoods would be directly affected by such action  That is why Mr Chairman I strongly support HR 1459 the Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act sponsored by our colleague from Utah Mr Bishop This legislation would require public participation before a President can designate a national monument under the Antiquities Act  Mr Chairman let me repeat this last sentence that I gave because this is the heart of the legislation This legislation would require public participation before a President can designate a national monument under the Antiquities Act  Over 100 years ago the Antiquities Act was passed to allow a President to unilaterally designate national monuments without any input or involvement from the people communities or elected officials of the areas that would be directly impacted  However this authority was intended to be used under narrow circumstances and in emergencies to prevent destruction of a precious place but unfortunately we have seen this power abused by Presidents of both parties It has been used as a tool to score political points rather than to protect areas facing imminent threat or harm  National monuments are one of the most restrictive of all land use designations They can significantly block public access and limit public recreation and other jobcreating economic activities  The American people and their elected leaders deserve to have a say in which of their lands deserve special protections as national monuments and which should instead be allowed to contribute to the full range of recreational conservation economic and resource benefits that carefully managed multipleuse lands provide  HR 1459 would guarantee public involvement and ensure that the designation process is transparent by requiring all national monument designations made under the Antiquities Act to comply with the NEPA process  Most if not all major land use decisions are statutorily required to go through the NEPA process Designations made by the President should be treated no differently than those other processes  I will openly state however that Iand many of my Republican colleaguesbelieve that NEPA is a law that should be streamlined and updated However this bill is about transparency and ensuring that the public has a voice  So let me ask the rhetorical question Mr Chairman If my Democrat colleagues believe that the NEPA is a worthwhile law that works and that NEPA is important why should they oppose making sure that Presidential designations should not go through the same process  This bill continues to uphold the original intention of the Antiquities Act which is to allow the President to act in emergency situations It protects the Presidents ability to act if there is an eminent threat to an American antiquity by allowing for a temporary emergency designation of 5000 acres or less for a 3year period  After that time in order to ensure public participation in the process the designation would be made permanent if the NEPA process is completed or if it is approved by Congress  The bill would also limit national monument declarations to no more than one per State during any 4year Presidential term and prevent the inclusion of private property in monument designations without the prior written consent of the property owners  National monument designations deserve public input from the people and communities who are directly impacted This bill is necessary to stop unilateral actions by the President and ensure participation by the American public  I commend subcommittee Chairman Bishop for his work on this bill and I encourage my colleagues to support it  Mr Chairman I reserve the balance of my time
