 of Michigan Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I might consume  I rise in support of H Res 506 directing the House Fine Arts Board to place a bust of Vaclav Havel in the United States Capitol which will serve as an honor of his exemplary life and legacy  Vaclav Havel was a man of many talents and contributions to the world He was a Czechoslovakian playwright essayist and poet  Born and raised in Prague during his formative years Havel and his family were among the countless who fell under oppression when the Communists came to power and confiscated all their property yet still he carried on finding his way professionally working in the arts but he knew he had more to give  Havels contributions to society are without measure Havel used his gifts of the written word to rally his countrymen behind the true meanings of freedom and the need for the human spirit to break free from the clutches of the communist empire  Within his wellknown essay The Power of the Powerless he insightfully pointed out how citizens under communist regimes were forced to live within a lie He stood as someone who would not be oppressed and served as a lead negotiator actually in what would be the end of more than four decades of communist rule  Many remember him for his instrumental role in the Velvet Revolution where he became a dominant figure in the final push for a democratic government  Havel fought for his home Czechoslovakia with words and with ideas and he aided the fight for the oppressed and he won Havel became a leader when his countrymen and women needed him the most  He was so respected by his peers in Czechoslovakia that he was chosen to lead postcommunist Czechoslovakia first as an interim President and then was voted unanimously to become President of Czechoslovakia in December of 1989 by its Parliament                              time  1545  In todays environment it is somewhat awe inspiring that he was so respected that he was unanimously elected to President You dont find that too often these days  Six months later Havel was elected as President at a popular election in July of 1990 and through his leadership and influence Mr Havel helped guide states from underneath the Soviet regime to their place in respected democracies in Europe He helped bring down the Iron Curtain and he aided his countrys transition into a free market economy He certainly deserves to be honored with his bust in this building that celebrates our own democracy and supports democracy liberty and freedom across the globe  So I urge my colleagues to support the resolution I reserve the balance of my time
