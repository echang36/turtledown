 This amendment simply caps the OCO We give the administration 1 more year of the Overseas Contingency Operations spending without any contingencies but beginning in 2016 OCO is subject to budget caps just like everything else  Funding the war in Afghanistan is not emergency spending We have been there for over a decade We all know what the costs entail The OCO is a socalled emergency account to keep the war in Afghanistan funded  I dont know about you Mr Speaker but the fact that we have troops in Afghanistan is no longer a surprise and is no longer an unexpected development  In addition the OCO has become a slush fund for Congress and the Pentagon to stick in goodies for procurement and operations and maintenance that it couldnt find room for in the Pentagons halftrillion dollar base budget  Now that Afghanistan President Karzai has made it perfectly clear that he doesnt want the United States or its military in Afghanistan we should at a minimum cap the OCO and bring our troops home now  So if we can find billions and billions of dollars to fund a war that nobody wants in a country where the government insults our troops every single day then we can use those moneys to fund real needs right at home like permanently fixing the SGR once and for all  We talk about trying to find common ground I think there is a lot of common ground on this issue amongst Democrats and Republicans I think there are a lot of Republicans who are just as sick of this endless war and this overthetop unaccounted for spending in these wars as Democrats are  So I think this is a sensible offset and I would urge my colleagues to support our initiative  I urge my colleagues to vote no and to defeat the previous question and vote no on the underlying bills for all the reasons I said before We should be using the taxpayer dollars to do things to help people on this House floor not to advance political agendas  With that I yield back the balance of my time
