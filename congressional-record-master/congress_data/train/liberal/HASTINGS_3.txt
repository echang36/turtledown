 of Washington Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume  The legislation before the House today enjoys bipartisan and bicameral support in Congress and the strong endorsement of the affected local communities  Our colleague Mr Daines of Montana is the lead sponsor of this bill and he has championed its action here in the House I can assure everyone that it is because of his leadership his commitment and energy that this legislation will pass the House today Mr Daines has put the interests of Montana first and has been willing to work in a bipartisan way with Republicans and Democrats to get this bill passed  Mr Speaker the North Fork Watershed Protection Act would codify protections of Federal forest lands in the North Fork watershed from development in accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed in 2010 between the Province of British Columbia and the State of Montana Very significantly the bill makes certain in law that existing uses including public recreation livestock management and forest management are protected and not restricted This bill will ensure that this region stays accessible for most of the traditional activities in this beautiful part of Montana  Mr Speaker in 1988 the Ninth Circuit Court enjoined the Department of the Interior from allowing any activity on issued oil and gas leases in this area Since then no oil and gas development has taken place in this area and several leaseholders have voluntarily relinquished their oil and gas leases within this area The State of Montana has made clear its desire to partner with British Columbia as I have mentioned to protect this watershed HR 2259 would similarly protect the Federal land located within this region  Again I would like to recognize the author of this legislation Mr Daines for his hard work and leadership and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation  I reserve the balance of my time
