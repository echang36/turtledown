 LEE Mr Speaker I rise today to commemorate the 27th observance of the National Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month and to add my respect and understanding that developmental disabilities may be visible or invisible and range from physical impairment that involves vision or mobility to those conditions that affect cognitive functions related to how the brain processes information and how someone learns I am also actively involved in the Dyslexia Caucus in efforts to shine the light on dyslexia  Developmental disabilities which include autism deficit hyperactivity disorder and other developmental delays have increased requiring more health and education services  I want to reemphasize the need for access to education services but also to work It is not a respect of age Sometimes it comes because of accident or of illness that people can become disabled but they are still deserving of the opportunity to work and they also deserve the opportunity to access the various assets that this country has  It is important that we focus on language focus on mobility and we provide the resources necessary My salute to those who are supporting the improvement of access for those suffering from developmental disabilities or experiencing it We look forward to working together
