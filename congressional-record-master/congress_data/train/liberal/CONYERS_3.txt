 Mr Chairman ladies and gentlemen of the House my amendment would exclude actions to combat discrimination and protect civil rights enforcement from the scope of this bill before us  The last thing we should want to do as a Congress is to pass legislation that makes it more difficult to protect our citizens civil rights by executive action or otherwise yet if HR 4138 had been law several of the most critical civil rights milestones of our Nation would have been subject to unnecessary congressional challenge in the courts  In 1863 President Abraham Lincoln issued perhaps the most important executive order in our Nations history the Emancipation Proclamation and by this order Lincoln freed the slaves in those southern States that were engaged in military conflict with the Union  By doing so Lincoln not only encouraged slaves to take up arms in fighting the Civil War for the Union he also struck a blow for freedom that resonated around the world  By issuing the order however President Lincoln made a decision to not enforce thenexisting laws protecting the institution of slavery including the Federal Fugitive Slave Act  Clearly history has shown Lincolns decision to be not only a legal and a military turning point but morally correct and clearly had the socalled ENFORCE Act been law the Emancipation Proclamation could have been subject to an unnecessary and unhelpful legal challenge in the courts from the Congress  Another example is President Trumans Executive Order 9981 issued in 1948 that desegregated the United States military With more than 125000 African Americans serving overseas in World War II this was a worthwhile and appropriate action by the President  Nevertheless by issuing this order Truman contravened the thenmilitary policy of segregating certain African American military units from white units  Again had this bill before us been law it would have permitted an unnecessary congressional legal challenge in the courts and such a challenge would not have been politically unpopular in many quarters  Remember that 1948 was the year that Strom Thurmond bolted from the Democratic Party to form the Dixiecrats and went on to carry four States and strongly compete in many others in the Presidential election  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to please consider the unintended consequences of the legislation before us It would not only represent a permanent stain on the principle of separation of powers written by our Founding Fathers into the Constitution but it would make it far more difficult to protect our citizens civil rights and other constitutional protections  Accordingly I urge a yes vote to protect civil rights and I yield back the balance of my time
