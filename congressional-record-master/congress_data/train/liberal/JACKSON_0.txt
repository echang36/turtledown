 LEE Mr Speaker I rise in opposition once again to an attempt by the majority to defeat the Affordable Care ActPage H2174  This begins the third year that the majority has attempted to put an end to affordable available and accessible health care for all Americans  They have ignored the law a Supreme Court decision and a national presidential election that affirmed the establishment legality and popularity of the Affordable Care Act  I oppose this bill for three reasons there are much more pressing issues facing our nation this bill is wrong on the facts and the Affordable Care Act is working  There are much more pressing issues facing our nation unemployment food security housing security and access to job training that leads to employment  We should be debating a bill to restore emergency supplemental unemployment benefits  We should be restoring cuts the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that was cut by nearly 20 billion dollars over several years  We should be voting to raise the minimum wage to 1010 an hour over several years and link future increases of the minimum wage to inflation  We should be taking up the budget process with eagerness to avoid another government shutdown  In 2013 we had a Federal government shutdown because we lost precious legislative time voting to repeal or seriously diminish the ability of the Affordable Care Act to do what it is currently doingproviding health insurance to millions of Americans  Every wasted votemoves this Congress another step closer to another Federal government shutdown  The budget process takes months of work by over a dozen committees to complete  Each vote that stops our legislative work and bring us to the floor for a debate on legislation that will not go anywhereis time taken away from our work to avoid another government shutdown  The American people were unaware of the cost of over 40 votes to end Obamacare until millions of citizens were put out of work when the government shutdown last year  They are watching what is happening in Congress very closely and the consequences will fall heaviest on those who were hurt by the last government shutdown  The 113th Congress has 70 legislative working days left on the calendar before September 30 2014the end of the fiscal year for 2014 and the beginning of the fiscal year for 2015  I call on my colleagues to bring to the floor bills like HR 3773 the Unemployment Jobhunters Protection and Assistance Act a bill I introduced that would extend emergency unemployment compensation EUC payments for eligible individuals to weeks of employment ending on or before January 1 2015  This Congress would find a better use of its time if it would take up consideration of HR 3888 New Chance for a New Start in Life Act of 2014 that would authorize the Secretary of Labor to make grants to States units of local government and Indian tribes to carry out employment training programs to assist longterm unemployed job hunters to obtain the skills and training they need to reenter the workforce and fill jobs in highgrowth sectors of the economy  These are just two bills that would improve the lives of people who we all serve but there are dozens of others introduced by members who came to the Congress to serve the will of the people and not their own will  I oppose this bill because it is wrong on the facts  Republicans are claiming that this bill is simply logical because the Administration has already delayed the employer responsibility provision for one year  This claim is inaccurate and disingenuous  Nonpartisan experts agree that there is no comparison between the impacts of a delay in the employer responsibility and individual responsibility provisions  For example in a report in July the nonpartisan Urban Institute concluded Delaying or eliminating the individual mandate would significantly decrease insurance coverage relative to the full Affordable Care Acts implementation whereas delaying or eliminating the employer mandate will have essentially no effect on coverage  The Affordable Care Act is good for the American People  The Obamacare is popular and growing in greater popularity everyday as consumers get past the rhetoric and experience the reality of the peace of mind that health insurance for their families and themselves brings  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act in Texas  5198000 individuals on private insurance have gained coverage for at least one free preventive health care service such as a mammogram birth control or an immunization in 2011 and 2012 In the first eleven months of 2013 alone an additional 1683800 people with Medicare have received at least one preventive service at no out of pocket cost  The up to 10695000 individuals with preexisting conditions such as asthma cancer or diabetesincluding up to 1632000 childrenwill no longer have to worry about being denied coverage or charged higher prices because of their health status or history  Approximately 5189000 Texans have gained expanded mental health and substance use disorder benefits andor federal parity protections  4889000 uninsured Texans will have new health insurance options through Medicaid or private health plans in the Marketplace  As a result of new policies that make sure premium dollars work for the consumer not just the insurer in the past year insurance companies have sent rebates averaging 95 per family to approximately 726200 consumers  In the first ten months of 2013 233100 seniors and people with disabilities have saved on average 866 on prescription medications as the health care law closes Medicares so called donut hole  357000 young adults have gained health insurance because they can now stay on their parents health plans until age 26  Individuals no longer have to worry about having their health benefits cut off after they reach a lifetime limit on benefits and starting in January 7536000 Texans will no longer have to worry about annual limits either  Health centers have received 293038000 to provide primary care establish new sites and renovate existing centers to expand access to quality health care Texas has approximately 400 health center sites which served about 1079000 individuals in 2012  Every day more uninsured Americans are signing up for plans as the website gets faster and more people with insurance are benefiting from the law  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to not spend any more precious legislative work on efforts to end the Affordable Care Act or ignoring the number of people continuing to vote in favor of the new law with their insurance enrollment dollars  Mr Speakers I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this bill
