 Mr Speaker I rise today to mark Womens History Month and to recognize the important role that women play in our workforce businesses and homes  In fact 40 percent of working women are the primary breadwinners in their families and it is just a fact that the success of our Nation relies on the economic security of women Unfortunately outdated policies are constraining the ability of women to participate fully in our economy Many face a lack of goodpaying jobs a high cost of education and child care In fact twothirds of minimum wage workers are women and the poverty rate for women is 145 percentthe highest in two decades Women earn just 77 cents on the dollar For African American women it is only 64 cents on the dollar For Latinas it is a shocking 58 cents on the dollar  That is why House Democrats have launched an economic agenda for women When Women Succeed America Succeeds We have got to raise the minimum wage to 1010 an hour increase tipped wages which havent been raised in 23 years have equal pay for equal work paid sick days and access to quality affordable child care  Women are playing an expanded role in our economy and in our country It is time we recognize their contribution because when women succeed America succeeds
