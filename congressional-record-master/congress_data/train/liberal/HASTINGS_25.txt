 of Washington I yield myself the balance of my time  Mr Chairman to hear my friends on the other side of the aisle argue about this they are making arguments that are pre1977 Now why do I say that Because they are talking about their perception of mountaintop mining or surface mining probably in general Well it is precisely that argument that led to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 under the Carter administrationwith a Democrat Congress I might add So that bill passed to allow for surface mining  Now there is always necessary rulemaking that comes after that and the latest rulemaking prior to the turn of this century was in 1983 under the Reagan administration So the Bush administration looked because of some court test that maybe we ought to rewrite this rule and Mr Chairman contrary to what my friends on the other side of the aisle said that that was a latebreaking rule it took 5 years to put that together5 years to put that together  So as a result because of this court decision that ended up vacating because of the technicality of the 2008 rule the issue before us is this Do we put the 2008 rule in place which is what the focus of this legislation is and then look forward to further rulemaking or do we vacate the 2008 rule and go back to 1983 That is what the choice is  What I find that is so interesting about my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that everybody acknowledges that the 2008 rule is more restrictivemore restrictivebut they want to go back to the 1983 rule I find that hard to understand but at least that is what appears to be their argument  So Mr Chairman we think the responsible way to do this is to take into consideration what the Bush administration did for 5 years looking at proper rulemaking that by the way looked into the Endangered Species Act That is something the 83 rule did not look at at all So we think that is a better way to put that in place right now It is a more restrictive rule that industry understands the States understand and it is probably better for energy certainty in this country  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation and I yield back the balance of my time
