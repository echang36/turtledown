 Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume  The gentleman says that this has nothing to do with President Obama The committee report only cites President Obama in terms of this issue and their political document the memorandum that came from Eric Cantor to the House Republicans talks about the Imperial Presidency and says President Obama has provided new clarity of what constitutes an Imperial Presidency President Obama President Obama and on and on  It just defies logic for anybody to think for one second that this isnt about trying to attack this President of the United States because what we have seen time and time again from the time this President was elected has been nothing but obstructionism and attack obstructionism and attack obstructionism and attack I get it There are differences in philosophies between the two parties  What is troubling to me is that in this imperial Republican Congress President Obamas ideas dont even get a chance to have their day on the floor where we are routinely shut out  In this imperial Republican Congress we cannot bring to the floor a bill to increase the minimum wage We cannot bring to the floor a bill to extend unemployment benefits for those over 2 million longterm employed We cannot bring to the floor a jobs bill We cannot bring to the floor the bipartisan Senatepassed comprehensive immigration reform bill which would do the right thing on behalf of a number of immigrants in this country but would also by the way we are told reduce our deficit  We cant even bring those things to the floor for debate Under this imperial Republican leadership our hands are tried So we try procedural motions We are trying discharge petitions We are trying whatever we can to try to be heard  I think it is important for the American people to know where people stand So if my friends on the other side of the aisle dont believe the American people deserve a raise if they dont believe we should increase the minimum wage vote against it Go on record Let the American people see where you stand On immigration reform if you dont want to reform the immigration system fine Vote against it when it comes to the floor  When my friends on the other side of the aisle routinely and regularly deny us the opportunity to even consider these things that hurts our democracy It diminishes this institution  If you want to talk about imperialism what is that  With that Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
