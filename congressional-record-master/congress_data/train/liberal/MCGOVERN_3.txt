 Mr Speaker I rise today to call attention to the third anniversary of the crisis in Syria which will be commemorated on March 15 The United Nations estimates that over 100000 people have been killed since the violence and unrest began in 2011 93 million people half of the Syrian people need humanitarian assistance 240000 of them are living under siege surviving under the constant threat of shelling and aerial bombardment Moreover they have faced lifethreatening shortages of food water and medical supplies for more than a year Children are literally starving to death while military forces show no respect for humanitarian workers  A diplomatic end to the crisis must be pursued At the same time the humanitarian crisis must be ameliorated Humanitarian relief must be allowed to reach the civilians and the wounded and the sick must receive the medical attention that they need Indiscriminate aerial bombardments must cease and civilians must be granted safe passage out of the besieged areas The Syrian people need unrestricted humanitarian aid now                                                       UNICEF                                      New York NY Mar 11 2014 Number of Children Suffering More Than Doubles in Third Year of Syria                                 Conflict  Among hardest hit are 1 million children under siege and in hardto                              reach areas       As the conflict in Syria approaches another sombre      milestone more than twice as many children are now affected      compared to 12 months ago says a new report by UNICEF      published today Particularly hard hit are up to a million      children who are trapped in areas of Syria that are under      siege or that are hard to reach with humanitarian assistance      due to continued violence       Under Siegethe devastating impact on children of three      years of conflict in Syria focuses on the immense damage      caused to the 55 million children now affected by the      conflict and calls for an immediate end to the violence and      increased support for those affected       The report includes the accounts of children whose lives      have been devastated by the three year old war and      highlights the profound traumas many have experienced      Children such as fouryearold Adnan who fled with his      family to Lebanon suffered facial scarring when his home was      bombed and still suffers from emotional distress He cries      all night his mother is quoted as saying He is scared      of everything and is afraid when we leave him even for a      second       UNICEF estimates that there are 2 million children like      Adnan in need of psychological support or treatment       For Syrias children the past three years have been the      longest of their lives Must they endure another year of      suffering said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake       The report warns that the future of 55 million children      inside Syria and living as refugees in neighbouring countries      hangs in the balance as violence the collapse of health and      education services severe psychological distress and the      worsening economic impact on families combine to devastate a      generation       The report draws attention to the suffering experienced by      children and their families who have been trapped in areas      under siege for many months Cut off from aid living in      rubble and struggling to find food many Syrian children have      been left without protection medical care or psychological      support and have little or no access to education In the      very worst cases children and pregnant women have been      deliberately wounded or killed by snipers       In host countries 12 million Syrian children are now      refugees living in camps and overwhelmed host communities      and have limited access to clean water nutritious food or      learning opportunities       The report says that three years on Syrian children have      been forced to grow up faster than any child should UNICEF      estimates that 1 in 10 refugee children is now working and 1      in every 5 Syrian girls in Jordan is forced into early      marriage       The report calls on the global community to undertake six      critical steps       End the cycle of violence in Syria now       Grant immediate access to the underreached 1 million      children inside Syria       Create an environment where children are protected from      exploitation and harm       Invest in childrens education       Help childrens inner healing through psychological care      and support and       Provide support to host communities and governments to      mitigate the social and economic impact of the conflict on      families       This war has to end so that children can return to their      homes to rebuild their lives in safety with their family and      friends This third devastating year for Syrian children must      be the last said Lake
