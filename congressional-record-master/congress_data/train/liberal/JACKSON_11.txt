 LEE Mr Speaker I rise today to address a question that the American people have been raising for more than a decade When will we address the question of human dignity of so many who are in our country who desire the status of citizenship When will we pass a sensible reasonable immigration reform legislation or package Will we combine our concern for national security with border security along with human dignity  The question is being asked by constituents from my 18th Congressional District in Houston It is being asked by the American Jewish Committee It is being asked by Cardinal DiNardo in the most eloquent and passionate way as they met last week to hear from voices of those who have not heard the answer Or the 139 who showed up at a press conference some weeks ago standing with me demanding that people be given their human dignity Or the leadership from Ireland who was here at a St Patricks Day luncheon who stood up and asked the Speaker When are we going to put comprehensive immigration reform on the floor of the House  This is a multicultural challenge to America This is an economic challenge This is from the Irish This is from South Asians from Asians This is from people from Bangladesh from Poland It is all over America Lets pass comprehensive immigration reform
