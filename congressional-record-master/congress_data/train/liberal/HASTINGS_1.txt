 of Washington Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume  This bill reflects decades of work work by local citizens who organized to reject the dictates of the Federal bureaucracy and to protect public access and recreation At the same time that this bill designates new wilderness it also provides critical protections for the publics ability to visit and enjoy the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in the State of Michigan Let me give you a little bit of background  In 1981 the National Park Service proposed a general management plan for the lakeshore in Michigan The plan was so restrictive as to be punitive towards recreation and it sparked a local backlash After years of collaboration a new plan was agreed upon that realigned the wilderness boundaries to restore sensible public access  This legislation would codify these negotiated changes into law and ensure the continued availability of roads for visitors traveling to remote trailheads to beaches to backcountry areas and to historic areas within this geography The bill also protects motorboater access to the shoreline It specifically protects private property rights It preserves hunting and fishing rights and it does not expand Federal land ownership or add any additional costs to taxpayers  As I stated this effort has been going on for several decades After the House votes today this bill will go to the President for his signature in order to become law Yet Mr Speaker the realPage H2126credit for this legislation even though it is a Senate bill is owed to our colleague from Michigan Dr Benishek for making this happen He is the lead sponsor of this legislation or the companion legislation in the House of Representatives Dr Benishek has been a persistent and persuasive advocate for this local proposal  As the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee which oversees this bill I can state with certainty that it is because of his Dr Benisheks bipartisan efforts that this bill will pass the House tonight He has worked closely with both Republicans and Democrats especially his senior Senator Senator Levin of Michigan to make this a reality Without their personal efforts todays vote would not happen  Dr Benishek certainly deserves recognition for this success and I congratulate him and the people of Michigan whom he represents for this legislation  With that I reserve the balance of my time
