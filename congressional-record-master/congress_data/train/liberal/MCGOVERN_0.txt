 Mr Speaker House Republicans led by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan criticize our Nations antipoverty programs Some want to drastically change them and others want to eliminate them altogether Over the past 6 months we have seen 19 billion in cuts to SNAP alone our Nations premier antihunger program  Participation in SNAP reached an alltime high a few years ago because of the Great Recession the worst economic period since the Great Depression That is because people were either unemployed or underpaid  If you want to reduce SNAP participation it is simple put more people back to work and better paying jobs Yesterday the Center for American Progress released a report showing how easy one step is They found that increasing the minimum wage to 1010 would move about 35 million people off of SNAP simply because they wouldnt need it  We shouldnt arbitrarily cut antipoverty programs like SNAP We must make commonsense changes like increasing the minimum wage if we are truly going to end hunger in this country
