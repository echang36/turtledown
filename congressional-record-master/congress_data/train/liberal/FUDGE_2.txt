 Mr Speaker as our economy continues to experience high levels of unemployment and a flat labor participation rate now is not the time to further decimate vital assistance to those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own I will not abandon 2 million Americans including 200000 veterans We must give them a hand up  Yesterday I signed a discharge petition to force action on extending unemployment insurance benefits a move supported by more than threefourths of the American people  Additionally nationally there are three unemployed people for each job created For the longterm unemployed there is just a 12 percent chance of finding a new job in any given month  Congress must extend unemployment benefits to help keep American families out of poverty as they seek jobs Each week we fail to act another 72000 people lose their benefits We must act now
