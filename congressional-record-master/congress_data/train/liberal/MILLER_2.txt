 of Michigan Mr Speaker I would simply close by saying Vaclav Havel passed away on December 18 2011 in the Czech Republic He was 75 years old And what an incredible life this man led and I think certainly displaying his bust in the United States Capitol is certainly an appropriate and fitting tribute So I would urge my colleagues as well to unanimously support this resolution  I yield back the balance of my time
