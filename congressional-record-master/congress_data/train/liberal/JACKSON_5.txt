 LEE Mr Chair let me thank the ranking member for his kindness the managers of this legislation and all of my colleagues that have come to the floor to try to seek truth  We have often said Truth to power The Constitution is the powerful document that all of us abide by We take an oath of office to do so  Going through the markup as we do in regular order we as the loyal opposition over and over again try to query what was the truth of this legislation what was the purpose of it and how was it going to be valid in light of the Constitution and the powers that are inured to the Presidency  The Presidency has executive powers and those powers were on the basis of his or her ability to work with the three branches of government Now we have legislation that wants to do a number of things like abolish the powers of the Presidencyabolish them because you disagree with policy  Believe me all of us would like standing to challenge anything We understand that when we made that attempt on several occasions the courts have said You dont have standing it is to the people  So now we want to orchestrate that so that rather than the legislative process which is given to the Congress we desire to go and put ourselves in place on immigration reform on protecting the environment on questions of justice whether it has to be ensuring that the election is unimpeded whether it has to do with correcting policies that need to be corrected We now want to get in front of that rather than doing it through the legislative process  I am glad my colleagues have spoken about immigration because one of the bills that did not come forward was to abolish a position that the administration has every right to utilize dealing with advocacy for undocumenteds who are in a detention center who are not charged particularly with criminal acts  We already know that there is a veto threat and it is a veto threat not for the present President of the United States but to uphold the Constitution  So the charge is that there is no trust in this President and there is a violation of the ConstitutionI can assure you that people beyond this body would raise the issue of constitutionality if it was real It is not  There are some professors who want to write a variety of law review papers and want to talk about how far we are exceeding our powers These are purely addressing the question of the law and making sure that the law is applied fairly
