 of Florida Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman my good friend from Florida for yielding me the customary 30 minutes  Just last week I found myself standing here managing a rule for two very similar bills At the time I thought we were on a merrygoround aimlessly moving in useless circles I will stand by that analogy again today  When similar bills came before Congress last session the Senate didnt pass them The President said he would not sign them as he has this particular legislation It seems to me that these measures are a foregone conclusion  Ultimately the same tired talking points might be a fun ride for some but they will never actually take you anywhere This kind of spinning in circles is a favorite tactic it seems of my friends on the other side of the aisle  For example this Congress has already taken 109 antienvironmental votes Last Congress it was 247 These were votes against clear air against clean water and to destroy our planet for future generations  Under Republican leadership we have also voted to repeal as we did a day or so ago the Affordable Care Act 50 different times a law that in many respects has led to millions of Americans signing up for health insurance that didnt have it before  And I will continue to ask my colleagues If you dont like that particular measure where is yours that would replace it And apparently nothing is forthcoming at least until this time  Based on the frequency of these quixotic votes it is obvious that my friends across the aisle have given up or are not interested in governing or addressing any of the issues that are most pressing to this Nation  Consider for instance that there are 2 million Americans relying on Congress to extend unemployment insurance with close to 200000 of them being unemployed veterans who have sacrificed time and again for our country  Last week I said the following       We should be spending the Houses time on extending      unemployment insurance working on comprehensive immigration      reform and raising the minimum wage  My friends on the other side of the aisle have continued to ignore the plight of middle class and working poor Americans immigrants hoping for a better life for their families and denying the undeniable impact of climate change just to name a few  We should be raising the minimum wage in order to give millions of hardworking Americans the pay they have earned Nearly 5 years have passed since the last increase in the Federal minimum wage Currently a fulltime minimum wage worker makes less than 16000 per year which is below the poverty line for a family of two or more  My friends did not take my suggestions last week and I doubt they will take them this week Instead we are considering two more pointless bills that will go nowhere One of them the acronym for it is RAPID That is correct Rapidly and fastly it will go nowhere  The first of todays bills HR 2641 ignores the fact that for more than 40 years the National Environmental Policy Act has provided an effective framework for all types of proposed actions that require Federal approval pursuant to a Federal law such as the Clean Water Act                              time  0930  HR 2641 is based on the assumption that the NEPA environmental review and permitting process results in project delays  However when we considered this measure last Congress the Congressional Research Service reported that delays in construction project approvals are more often tied to local State and projectspecific factors These factors include primarily localState agency priorities project funding levels local opposition to a project project complexity or late changes in project scope not to mention the litigation that goes on surrounding these measures  CRS goes even further reporting that even most environmental project delays are not the result of NEPA but actually due to laws other than NEPA The measure undermines current regulatory protections and could jeopardize public health and safety by prioritizing speed over meaningful analysis  Now turning to HR 2824 the other measure included in todays rule which like the 50 times that we voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act my Republican friends have done that they have also offered 50 rules which are not open rules in spite of the fact that we began this session by the Speaker of the House saying that this would be the most open House that we have had  HR 2824 included in this rule is no more productive than the previous legislation offered The legislation would overturn a court decision in order to block a buffer requirement designed to prevent damage to waterways from surface coal mining operations These are protections that President Ronald Reagan put in place  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that over 500 mountains have been destroyed by the practice of mountaintop removal mining more than 12 million acres of forest has been eliminated and nearly 2000 miles of streams have been buried or polluted by these mining projects I wonder what part of knocking a mountaintop off do people not understand as destruction and if it is to be that it should be done carefully  These are protections for all of us in our society As many as 60000 additional cases of cancer in central Appalachia are directly linked to mountaintop removal and more than 700 additional deaths from heart disease occur each year  Last month West Virginia University scientists published a study confirming high air pollution levels around mountaintop removal coal mines suggesting a link to the higher rates of cardiovascular disease birth defects and cancer that is seen in these communities  Instead of addressing these issues HR 2824 would reinstate a George W Bush administration rule that essentially prohibits the United States Department of the Interior from implementing any protections for streams against mountaintop removal and coal mining  Let me lift the comment of Judge Charles Haden in a case called Bragg v Robertson The judge saysPage H2205       When valley fills are permitted in intermittent and      perennial streams they destroy those stream segments The      normal flow and gradient of the stream is now buried under      millions of cubic yards of excess spoil waste material an      extremely adverse effect If there are fish they cannot      migrate If there is any life form that cannot acclimate to      life deep in a rubble pile it is eliminated No effect on      related environmental values is more adverse than      obliteration Under a valley fill the water quality of the      stream becomes zero Because there is no stream there is no      water quality  The Bush rule in 08 was vacated by the District of Columbia District Court on February 20 2014 The Obama administration started to draft new stream protections upon taking office into which the minority has conducted a long fruitless investigation Indeed the years of investigation have uncovered no misconduct The only results of the investigation are wasted time and taxpayer money sending over 13500 pages of documents 25 hours of audio recordings 19000 staff hours and costing the United States Department of the Interior and Office of Surface Mining approximately 15 million  We saw an example yesterday in one of our committees investigating the Internal Revenue Service for something that just simply has not occurred in any partisan fashion And I can demonstrate that because if one believes that the IRS only went after conservative organizations within the time period that was being investigated by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform then it was not during that period that my church Mt Hermon AME Church in Fort Lauderdale received the same kind of notices that are being complained about and what we did was what everybody has every right to do which is make the necessary appeal and we were successful in that regard  All of these partisan witch hunts need to stop We are a better people than this and we should be about the business of the people of the United States of America  Mr Speaker todays measure exists as partisan talking points bumper sticker talk by my Republican colleagues rather than serious legislation to move this country forward  I reserve the balance of my time
