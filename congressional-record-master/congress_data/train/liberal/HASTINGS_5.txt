 of Washington Mr Speaker HR 2197 authorizes the National Park Service to study 1125 miles of the York River in the State of Maine for possible inclusion into the Wild and Scenic Rivers program  The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 was intended to put a development freeze on rivers to preserve their freeflowing characteristics Although no immediately apparent risks to the river necessitating Federal designation have been identified proponents of the study explained that they would benefit from the expertise of the National Park Service and its interaction with the surrounding community  Due to a number of very real concerns that have arisen through prior designations this bill includes several commonsense provisions aimed at better informing local property owners and communities about the full effects and impacts of a wild and scenic designation  The National Park Service will be required to consider the effect of designation on commercial and recreational uses such as hunting and fishing and boating The study must also look at the impact on construction and maintenance of energy production and transmission  Furthermore HR 2197 requires the Federal Government to identify all existing authorities that could be utilized to condemn private property We want property owners to know how much power the government will be given so they can form an educated opinion as to whether they should participate in or support a Wild and Scenic Rivers designation  Finally the bill will require the Federal Government to identify those authorities that compel it to become involved in local zoning While Federal designation of the York River clearly has an appeal to the local advocates supporting this legislation it is important for the community to be aware that the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act requires local zoning to conform to the dictates of the Federal act  Lastly Mr Speaker I would note that this exact legislation passed the House last Congress but because the Senate failed to act on it it is being considered once again in this Congress  Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time
