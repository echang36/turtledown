 LEE Mr Speaker this happens to be Womens History Month I will continue to salute the dynamic women of this Nation  I rise today as a founder and cochair of the Congressional Childrens Caucus and indicate to my colleagues that I believe we are overdue for naming children as our number one priority Working with First Focus I intend to introduce a childrens budget for the needs of our children We have left children behind Many times the issues around children are discussed in a partisan way Who wants early childhood education Who wants universal preK or aroundtheclock child care  In actuality the consumers and beneficiaries of funding for those very important issues are our children We should give them the security protection and resources to prevent child abuse and for bringing families together and providing intervention for families that are troubled that result in not only child abuse but violence against these children  What about the best education they can have What about the best health care they can have  Mr Speaker children are our number one priority I truly believe that a childrens budget in the United States of America is long overdue  Join me on the childrens budget
