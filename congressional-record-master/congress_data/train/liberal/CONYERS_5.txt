 Mr Speaker Members of the House I am introducing a Jazz Appreciation Month piece of legislation entitled the National Jazz Preservation Education and Promulgation Act of 2014  In 1986 I introduced a bill in which simply sought to make a compelling statement about the importance of Jazz within American culture Its final clause read       Now therefore be it Resolved by the House of      Representatives the Senate concurring that it is the sense      of the Congress that jazz is hereby designated as a rare and      valuable national American treasure to which we should devote      our attention support and resources to make certain it is      preserved understood and promulgated  The jazz community came together in strong support of that legislation and through many phone calls and letters generated enough cosponsorships to get House Concurrent Resolution 57 passed by the US House of Representatives on September 23 1987 The fact that the 23rd was John Coltranes birthday made the accomplishment even more special for me and was able to secure approval of the bill by the US Senate a little more than two months later on December 4 1987  During my work on that bill which has come to be known as the Jazz Resolution I saw it inspire successful jazzrelated political activity at the local governmental level in New York City in Philadelphia and in Washington DC While each of these legislative victories were a milestone for the music with each making profound statements about the importance of jazz in those communities none of them directed financial resources toward its supportPage H2685So a couple of years later I began working through the Congressional appropriations process to do just that  In the Fall of 1990 I secured funding for the creation of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra I was able to obtain additional funds for the Smithsonians Jazz program on three subsequent occasions The result has been the solidification of a comprehensive Jazz program that involves preservation education and performance I chose to focus my efforts on the Smithsonian Institution because it serves as the nations treasure chest It is where all things American that are historic and valued are kept I wanted Jazz to have an appropriate and permanent place at the Smithsonian It has that now  I want to express my special thanks to Dr John Hasse the Smithsonians Curator of American Music for his leadership and strong support for Jazz I also want to congratulate him on establishing Jazz Appreciation Month JAM Today is the kickoff of the 13th JAM which has grown to become a global celebration of Jazz as Americas classical music I am pleased that John Coltrane one of our nations greatest musibians and composers was selected to be the focus of the 2014 JAM poster and todays JAM activities The Acknowledgement of his recording A Love Supreme 50 years ago in December 1964 is a great way to honor John Coltrane The fact that his original score of that iconic composition is a part of the Smithsonians collections and is on display there today is much appreciated  Jazz is now well over 100 years old Scores of many remarkable compositions artifacts documents and photographs are in private hands at risk of getting damaged lost or being sold abroad In addition jazz education at the elementary and secondary school level is virtually impossible to find As such in order to ensure the continued prominence of Jazz as a part Americas cultural heritage I have just introduced HR 4280 the National Jazz Preservation Education and Promulgation Act of 2014 This legislation would enable the further implementation the mandate established in H Con Res 57 It will help our nation preserve its jazz heritage educate our youth about this national treasure and encourage the promulgation of jazz by fostering opportunities for jazz artists to create and share their music with the public here and abroad  HR 4280 would authorize funding to establish a National Jazz Preservation Program at the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of American History The Program would create oral and video histories of leading jazz artists acquire preserve and interpret artifacts and conduct exhibitions and other educational activities that would enable generations of Americans to learn about and enjoy jazz The Program would also work with local museums educational institutions and community organizations to establish jazz collections and share artifacts between them  In addition the legislation promotes jazz education in several ways It encourages the introduction of jazz to our youth by authorizing funding to establish a Jazz Artists in the Schools Program This program should be modeled on the successful one previously operated by the National Endowment for the Arts It also authorizes funding for the development of jazz education curriculum and materials and their dissemination to educators at all levels The bill authorizes funding for a Jazz Ambassadors Program This program should be modeled on the historic one that the US State Department launched back in 1956 That program sent noted American jazz musicians abroad to perform My bill would enable young jazz musicians and jazz ensembles from secondary schools to be sent abroad on missions of goodwill education and cultural exchange  Finally HR 4280 promotes the promulgation of jazz by authorizing funding to support a nationwide series of performances by jazz artists This would be done through the establishment of a Jazz Appreciation Program at the Smithsonian Institution This program would work through the network of Smithsonian Affiliates to host jazz concerts The Affiliates network includes more than 180 museums educational and cultural organizations in more than 40 states Puerto Rico and Panama  I encourage all of you to take a look at and consider supporting HR 4280 I also encourage you to share a copy of it with others that have an interest in Americas jazz music
