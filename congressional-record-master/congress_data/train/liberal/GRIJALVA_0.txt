 Mr Chairman I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon Mr DeFazio the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee  Mr DeFAZIO I thank my friend and colleague for the time  Mr Chair since Congress passed the Antiquities Act in 1906 both Republican and Democratic Presidents have used the power granted under the act to protect some of our most recognizable most beloved natural wonders Grand Teton in Wyoming Zion in Utah Olympic in Washington and the Statue of Liberty That is a few  Last week I had the opportunity to backpack for 7 days in what is the best known and most visited44 million people last yearthe Grand Canyon of the United States  In 1908 Republican President Teddy Roosevelt granted national monument designation for the Grand Canyon under the Antiquities Act and all but two Presidents since then have used this authority  At that time it was critical to protect the Grand Canyon because tremendous development was being proposed both for tourism purposes and for commercial uses and mining and other issues so that was an extraordinary step that that President took back thenPage H2673  Why would we turn back the clock Why would we strip this President or future Presidents from having this authority to preserve and conserve national treasures when they are indefinitely stalled as was the Grand Canyon in the morass of Congress  It was dysfunctional for a different reason back then but it is just as dysfunctional or more dysfunctional today as it was back then There is going to be no protection passing this House easily or freely with this majority in charge  Now it is true that there have been some controversial designations one mentioned previously and earlier by Chairman Bishop but I would also note that no oneno onehas proposed legislation to repeal that designation by President Clinton  If they are so aggrieved and it is so egregious I wonder why they havent done that Perhaps because it enjoys tremendous popular support except from among a few people  Now they say this is about more control Lets take a look at what they have done with control Over the last 4 years the Republican majority has proposed legislation to sell off public lands  They have passed multiple bills that would open our public lands virtually unregulated as of yesterday to mountaintop removal mineral and energy extraction They shut down access to our national parks because of their stupid government shutdown last fall and they found out that wasnt too popular  Then they held a hearing to find out why the parks were shut down when the government was shut down Look in the mirror guys That is why the parks were shut down They found out that the parks and these monuments enjoyed tremendous support from the American people  There have been 89 conservation bills introduced from both sides of the aisle in this House in the last two Congresses and only four of the 89 have become law This Republican majority is genuinely openly hostile to conservation designations yet today they are pretending that they actually really care about these iconic places and they are just making a couple little changes to the law to include more public input  You know I have an experience from the Clinton administration for the Steens Mountains in Oregon We only got it done because President Clinton and Secretary Babbitt said we are going to make that a monument  Now we dont have as much flexibility in designation but if you would legislate something we will work with you  We had a meeting in my office with the Republican Senator a Republican Member from Oregon myself a couple of other Members came in and out and the Secretary and we hammered out a bill to protect the Steens Mountains in Oregon and it passed on a bipartisan basis in a Republican Congress with a Republican House and a Republican Senate Unfortunately those are the old days  As I said earlier 16 out of 19 Presidents have used this power Teddy Roosevelt said it best I think about the Grand Canyon that we should       Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is Do      nothing to mar its grandeur sublimity and loveliness You      cannot improve on it but what you can do is to keep it for      your children your childrens children and all who come      after you as the one great sight which every American should      see  Today the majority here would undo the potential for future legacies under the Antiquities Act  Just one side note Chairman Bishop made much of talking about in a Dear Colleague letter that there was a provision in legislation of which I was a sponsor critical and unique to my State designating the OC lands and he said it precludes new monument designations  Yes he is right That was in there at the insistence of the Republican majority I would have been happy to take it out but I will cut him a deal I would be happy to negotiate  He voted for that bill but it also includes 12 million acres of old growth preservation 90000 acres of wilderness 300000 acres of riparian setasides and 150 miles of wild and scenic designations  If he will fully support those conservation provisions in my bill I will perhaps negotiate with them that they could say well we wont do any more monuments in that area because we have already had a massive conservation victory  But that is why it is in the bill They insisted not me Lets not create phony arguments here  With that I urge my colleagues to reject this horrible legislation
