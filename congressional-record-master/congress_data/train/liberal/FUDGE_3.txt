 I thank the gentleman for yielding I want to thank Congressman Jeffries and Horsford for organizing this Special Order hour to celebrate Womens History Month  Throughout the month of March we highlight the important role womenPage H2594have playedand continue to playin our Nations history a role too often overlooked  My home State of Ohio has had a dynamic group of women who have changed the face of the State and of this country There are countless areas influenced by women including access to education and participation in our countrys democracy  Ohio women have made great strides in breaking down barriers In fact the first woman to run for President of the United States was from Ohio Ms Victoria C Woodhull was a writer and womens rights activist She ran for President in 1872 with the abolitionist Frederick Douglass as her running mate  While there has yet to be a woman elected President the number of women in elected offices has grown over the years However the rate of growth has been at a less than desirable pace  Despite the fact that women make up more than 50 percent of the Nations populous we are less than 20 percent of the US House of Representatives where until 1917 women were not represented at all  African American women often face compounded discrimination because of our race and gender As a result many of our firsts are more recent  In 1971 Ellen Walker CraigJones was the first African American woman elected mayor by popular vote for an American municipality leading Urbancrest Ohio  The first African American congresswoman to represent Ohio was my friend and predecessor Stephanie Tubbs Jones who was elected in 1998  While I could go on to detail the important firsts of more women from Ohio and what they have accomplished there is a better way and it is legislation  I am a cosponsor of HR 863 the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Womens History Museum Act of 2013 The National Womens History Museum would be the first museum to place a national spotlight on the many contributions women have made over the course of our countrys history  More accurately it is an opportunity to have a permanent place to acknowledge and to celebrate women who have shaped our history and will shape our future  Women continue to lead national dialogues on critical issues and advance policies and politics in ways that move this Nation forward including groundbreaking legislation like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act  When we are at the decisionmaking table we make the discussions more representative of our population while bringing a unique perspective which expands the conversation  That is why I will continue to support legislation that will amplify our voices and improve the quality of life for women across our Nation by increasing the minimum wage investing in quality early childhood education protecting reproductive rights and increasing access to highquality STEM Education  As we celebrate Womens History Month lets be mindful of the progress we have made and the work that still needs to be done because when women succeed America succeeds
