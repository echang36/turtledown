 of South Carolina Mr Speaker on rollcall No 147 I missed the vote on final passage of HR 1459 the Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act I supported this bill in the Natural Resources Committee and would have voted in favor of it on final passage Unfortunately business on the Senate side of the Capitol prevented me from voting before the rollcall ended Had I been present I would have voted aye
