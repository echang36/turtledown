 Thank you Mr Chairman  I come to the floor to support HR 2824 the Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America Act I thank my colleagues Congressman Johnson and Chairman Doc Hastings for their hard work and leadership on this very important issue  The Obama administration has consistently put mandates ahead of jobs and energy security Instead of promoting the Americanmade energy that powers our factories small businesses warehouses and offices Washington bureaucrats have wasted nearly 10 million to overhaul coal mining regulation  Three years ago the Obama administrations own experts estimated that these unnecessary and sweeping changes could kill 7000 jobs The urge to issue mandates was too strong and instead of listening to reason the administration fired its own advisers and kept on pressing That is no way to promote economic recovery  Mr Chairman todays legislation would halt the Obama administrations haphazard and disastrous rulemaking Hoosiers deserve an alloftheabove energy plan not a red tape agenda So I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation
