 Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume  I rise in strong support of this legislation This is the USIsrael Strategic Partnership Declaration  I want to begin by thanking the gentlewoman from Florida Ms RosLehtinen and thanking the gentleman from Florida Mr Ted Deutch for their leadership in authoring this important measure  Israels strategic reality has been fundamentally transformed As it looks to its borders and looks beyond those borders the threats to Israel are changing and they are growing These threats challenge Israels qualitative military edge and that is its ability to counter and defeat any credible conventional military threat It challenges it in ways that have perhaps never been quite so daunting  Myself Eliot Engel Ted Deutch and others had an opportunity last year to travel to Israel to see the effects see the efforts by Israel to counter the rocket attacks that come in from Gaza by Hamas  I had an opportunity back during the second Lebanon war during the war with Hezbollah to actually see the effects in August of 2006 of what was happening with rockets firing into Haifa On a daily basis the city was under siege  There were literally 600 IsraelisJewish Israelis Arab Israelis Druze Israeliswho were victims of these attacks from the communities in Haifa who were in the trauma hospital and every day these rockets would rain down  This was not just the handiwork of Hezbollah and of Hamas that we saw last yearno This was with rockets provided by Iranby Iran and Syria  In the rocket attacks that I saw in 2006 those rocketsevery one of themthe cone of those rockets had 80000 ball bearings and they would be fired on schools on homes on the hospital itself that was a target That was done to create the maximum number of civilian casualties  Well so it is in terms of the challenges that Israel faces again those challenges now because Iran is supplying the weaponry  In response the Congress continues to do everything in our power to support Israel from its security to supporting its economy That is the intention Mr Speaker of this legislation that Mr Ted Deutch and Ms RosLehtinen have brought before this body It is a matter of shared values shared experiences and shared interests between the United States and Israel  This legislation will not only expedite the provision of critical security assistance to Israel and require more frequent and detailed reporting on Israels qualitative military edge as well as a report on joint efforts to address the other threatsasymmetric threats that Israel faces but it will also focus on expanding cooperation in areas of mutual interest by supporting a range of joint activities from civil space cooperation to homeland security measures  Finally it will dramatically expand our cooperation with Israel on energy production It will link the two economies in important ways and that is why I again thank Ileana RosLehtinen and Ted Deutch for bringing this legislation before us  I reserve the balance of my time                                         House of Representatives                               Committee on Homeland Security                                 Washington DC January
