 Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume  Mr Speaker I rise in support of H Res 499 a very important declaration of support for the people of Ukraine in this time of peril This measure condemns Russias unprovoked aggression in clear and in unmistakable terms The US has a strong interest in a democratic and prosperous Ukraine and a Ukraine with its territorial integrity intact  I would like to take this time to recognize also Ranking Member Engel for coauthoring this bipartisan resolution and I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their work to strengthen this resolution at last weeks markup where it passed unanimously  This resolution is an important part of the larger effort to aid Ukraine and impose real costs on Russia to give Russia something to weigh in the balance something to take into account for its unacceptable action in the Crimea section of Ukraine  Among other resolves the resolution condemns the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty independence and territorial integrity by military forces of the Russian Federation and it declares that the Ukrainian people have the right to determine their own future free from outside interference  Importantly the resolution calls on the administration to work with our allies to impose visa financial and other sanctions as appropriate Russias actions cannot go unchallenged  To show Moscow how isolated its aggression has made it world leaders are speaking out Today the House of Representatives is joining those voices Ukraines new government is confronting an economic and financial crisis brought on by years of mismanagement and corruption by previous government officials and it is doing this while under military invasion and economic coercion by neighboring Russia  The new government in Kiev cannot succeed without strong and rapid support by the international community Last week the House acted quickly on a loan guarantee provision This is conditioned on Ukraines undertaking fundamental economic reforms to stabilize its economy  Addressing Ukraines energy security must be part of our response here While the United States recently became the worlds largest producer of natural gas Russia is still the largest exporter Moscow freely uses its energy resources to advance its foreign policy goals including by blackmailing countries which are dependent on Russia  Russia has repeatedly used its natural gas to pressure Ukraine economically and politically It recently announced that it will significantly hike its prices a deliberate effort to squeeze Ukraine in order to worsen its current economic crisis and to control it politically  Fortunately we have a readily available option to help counter this threat namely reducing the current impediments to exports of American natural gas to Ukraine While Vladimir Putin is selling oil and gas around the world we still maintain major restrictions on selling our energy to all but a handful of countries  We should end these selfimposed sanctions on our energy exports to Ukraine This would undermine Putins influence It would bolster our allies throughout Europe and create jobs at home  I urge all Members to support this important measure and I reserve the balance of my timePage H2270                                         House of Representatives
