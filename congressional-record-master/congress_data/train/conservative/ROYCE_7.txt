 Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume  Mr Speaker President Vladimir Putins decision to forcibly annex Crimea was based on his calculation that the price would be bearable  Now in fact Russia is susceptible to pressure Seventy percent of all the exports from Russia are from oil and gas 52 percent of the budget that goes to the power behind Mr Putins military and his government comes from that monopoly pricing on natural gas That supplies the budget for Russia That is what gives him the power to manipulate the situation the monopoly over gas that he has in Eastern Europe to manipulate this situation with respect to Ukraine  If we want to check aggression from Russia we must push back and we must work together quickly not only to confront this monopoly circumstance that exists there but also to quickly impose tough sanctions on President Putin and on those who have been his accomplices in carrying out this aggression  Diplomatically our European allies have helped to eject Russia from the G8 and have suspended all other engagement with Russia until this crisis is peacefully resolved Economically they have also imposed sanctions including asset freezes and visa bans against many Russian leaders Our targets must include government officials as well as those who hold no formal position but who nevertheless exercise great influence over President Putins policy and have supported aggression That includes the socalled oligarchs and others who have amassed enormous wealth through corruption and through other illegitimate means  We must make clear that if they do not end this crisiswhich they have deliberately created by the wayor if they choose to go even further then we and our allies will ratchet up the sanctions pressure  We must also move quickly to strengthen Ukraine by reinforcing its sovereignty its independence and territorial integrity and assist the new government in meeting the enormous challenges it faces  This bill provides assistance to strengthen civil society in Ukraine to combat corruption to help recover assets stolen by former Ukrainian officials to reform the police and the justice sector to promote the independentPage H2724media to strengthen Ukraines defense and to help prepare for the runup to the Presidential election which is scheduled now on May 25  And I will add that in several weeks I will be leading a bipartisan delegation from this House with the gentleman from New York Mr Engel to Ukraine And I will add that his forefathers in fact come from Ukraine We will be there to meet with the Parliament the leadership and the electoral commission in advance of that election  This bill also directs the assistance already approved by the House to help get the Ukrainian economy back on its feet including by promoting fundamental economic reforms in the country Those tough reforms will be essential  Mr Speaker Moscow is using propaganda to sow confusion and fear and unrest inside Ukraine right now which it then exploits to justify its actions To counter that effort this legislation enhances funding for Radio Free EuropeRadio Liberty and the Voice of America to expand broadcasting in the Russian language in Ukrainian in Tatar in order to provide the accurate news and information on the ground across Ukraine No amount of aid will help Ukraine if Russian propaganda rules the day  Another priority must be to end Russias ability to use its energy reserves to blackmail Ukraine and other countries including many of our NATO allies Russia supplies 100 percent of Lithuanias natural gas Well it might not be that surprising then that Lithuania pays the highest price for gas of any country in Eastern Europe And it supplies twothirds of Polands gas  Energy sales earn Russia not only dollars but they earn Russia influence because Russia in the dead of winter has turned off the valves Russias statecontrolled gas company Gazprom threatened to cut off supplies to Ukraine earlier this month as it did during the winters of 2006 and 2009 Gazprom has stated that it is preparing to double the price Ukraine pays for its natural gas which could cripple the countrys already weak economy  Now we have a powerful tool to counter this pressure one that is just waiting to be used and that is our own energy reserves We must remove restrictions on the export of US crude oil and natural gas into Eastern Europe We have in fact a letter to the Speaker of the House from the heads of state of Poland of the Czech Republic of Slovakia of Hungary asking usasking usto direct resources to sell resources  Listen at the end of the day if we do this we end the flaring of gas here in the United States because of the glut We are able to help our balance of payments It will help to reduce our deficits It increases Russias deficits frankly It produces jobs here in the United States But it comes at a time when Vladimir Putin has a grip on the necks of the decisionmakers in Eastern Europe with respect to his power on monopoly over gas  Lifting frankly these selfimposed sanctions on ourselves in terms of not exporting our excess gas would not only boost the US economy and create American jobs as I indicated but would reduce the energy revenues that comprise 52 percent of the budget for the military and the government in Russia We must break Putins energy grip over Ukraine and Eastern Europe This is a strategic issue  I am pleased by the way to have worked closely with Ranking Member Eliot Engel of New York and with all of the members of the committee to produce this strong effective and muchneeded bipartisan bill and I look forward to its passage today and to working with our Senate colleagues to have the President sign the bill into law as soon as possible  Mr Speaker
