 of Michigan Mr Speaker tonight the House passed legislation addressing an issue that is near and dear to my heart and very important to Michigan involving Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park  For years there has been a back and forth between the community surrounding Sleeping Bear Dunes and the National Park Service over the best way to make sure that this pristine treasure is accessible to the public  I have personally been involved in this process for over a decade and I am glad to see my friend and colleague Dr Dan Benishek who now represents the area pick up the legislative torch that my friend Pete Hoekstra and Iwe introduced bills to protect the Sleeping Bear Dunes and Dan has finally been able to take it across the finish line  This bipartisan and bicameral solution ensures that beaches will remain open public roads can be improved hunting and fishing will continue to be allowed and private property rights are actually protected  Tonights legislative achievement would not be possible without the hard work and tireless efforts of local citizens local business owners and local advocacy groups such as the Coalition for Access to the Lakeshore  I look forward to President Obama signing this muchneeded piece of legislation and the benefits that there will be for the visitors to the park the local residents and small businesses throughout northern Michigan  Most importantly lets see Sleeping Bear Dunes preserved for generations to come
