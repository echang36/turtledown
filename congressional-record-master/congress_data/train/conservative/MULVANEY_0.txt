 Madam Speaker I rise today to extend a special thankyou to the hardworking men and women across the Nation but especially in South Carolina who dedicate themselves to keeping the lights on during this difficult winter For so many of us switching on the light switch is something that we take for granted It is easy to forget all the hard work that goes into making that happen  A couple of weeks ago Winter Storm Pax hit South Carolina leaving a path of destruction in many of the smaller communities in my district without power crippled by the ice and snow It is something that was so dramatic that the executive director of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff said that the storm was the most significant weather event in South Carolina since Hurricane Hugo And I can assure you that for us that is saying a lot  To give some quick numbers as to what happened more than 3000 people went to work in South Carolina The folks from Duke Energy alone cleared more than 7000 trees off of the power lines in South Carolina It is these types of efforts that these folks put in every single winter to make sure that something that we take for granted actually happens when we flip on the lights  In recognition of those efforts the efforts that they undertake every single winter I am introducing a bill today to declare March 31 as National Lineman Appreciation Day  I hope we can count on my colleagues to send this very small thankyou It is not much but it is the least we can do to let these folks know that we dont always take them for granted
