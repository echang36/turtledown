 Mr Speaker yesterday the Supreme Court heard arguments in the Hobby Lobby case This business is simply asking that owners rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are respected  In an ironic bit of timing the administration just effectively waived the March 31 deadline for signing up for an ObamaCare plan  Despite President Obamas continuous extralegal rewriting of his health care law he remains unwilling to accommodate religious businessowners who are providing health care coverage for employees  Yesterday also brought a news report from North Carolina of 200 substitute teachers having their hours cut in order to comply with ObamaCare mandates The teachers plight is not unique  As Republicans noted during the original debate over this law putting the government in charge of 17th of the economy is a recipe for disaster  We need to repeal ObamaCare and enact health reform that empowers patients not bureaucrats
