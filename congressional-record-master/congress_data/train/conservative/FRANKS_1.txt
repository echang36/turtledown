 of Arizona Madam Speaker I now yield myself such time as I may consume  I begin by just pointing out contrary to the gentlemans assertion the term Federal officer is mentioned 238Page H2342times in the Federal Code and the Dictionary Act defines officer It includes any person authorized by law to perform the duties of the office  Contrary to some of the other discussions this bill is focused on trying to make sure that we faithfully enforce the laws and that we understand when the laws are perhaps being not enforced for persons suggesting that they are unconstitutional or otherwise  So Madam Speaker it is inherent I suppose in the nature of Washington DC politics that at a certain point all of the backandforth discussion eventually turns into white noise and the continual debating reporting and blaming is so commonplace that many Americans tune it out entirely  And just as the partisanship in Washington causes so many to tune out the substance of the debate so do we also become accustomed sometimes to hearing lofty rhetoric and allusions to our Founding Fathers But tonight I pray that we can all truly listen anew to the men whose ideas so revolutionized the world because the challenges we now face were not unforeseen Madam Speaker  James Madison in Federalist Paper 48 expressed his concern that eventually the mere rule of law might not be enough to restrain those who really had a mind to abuse the power of their office He said       Will it be sufficient to mark with precision the      boundaries of these departments in the Constitution of the      government and to trust to these parchment barriers against      the encroaching spirit of power But experience assures us      that the efficacy of the provision has been greatly      overrated and that some more adequate defense is      indispensably necessary for the more feeble against the more      powerful members of the government  When Madison originally published this paper in 1788 he did so using the title These Departments Should Not Be So Far Separated as to Have No Constitutional Control Over Each Other  Mr Madison expressed these concerns only 12 years after America had declared its independence And I would submit that in the intervening 226 years these abuses have spiraled out of control  I would urge Americans to ask themselves Has this administration moved our Nation back toward the noble dream imagined by men like James Madison when all laws were equally enforced and all people are equal under those laws or has this administration worsened the trend Madison detected so early on  President Obama infamously said on this very floor Madam Speaker       We are not just going to be waiting for legislation in      order to make sure that we are providing Americans the kind      of help they need I have got a pen and I have got a phone      And I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take      executive actions and administrative actions that move the      ball forward  To this I would humbly respond Madam Speaker no he cant not if what he is doing is abrogating the Constitution of the United States That is exactly the sort of overreach Madison warned us about and it is exactly what we are referencing when we talk about an Imperial Presidency  Unfortunately Madam Speaker we are dealing with a President who has admitted he would prefer to be unconfined by constitutional limitations He specifically said       Wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation      that is what I am going to do  Madam Speaker they say that to be forewarned is to be forearmed This President has not been shy about his intentions to go beyond the Constitution when he is inclined Under this administration the IRS has become a political tool used against those who oppose the Presidents policies The Justice Department has adopted a policy of selective law enforcement essentially rewriting the law by only enforcing the ones they prefer The Senates role in the appointment process has been ignored outright with the administration making socalled recess appointments even though the Senate was not in recess  The legislative branch has been deemed little more than an inconvenient hurdle with legislation like the DREAM Act and ObamaCare being either imposed via fiat or grossly and repeatedly modified without the input consent or action on the part of Congress  We have seen the unconstitutional seizure of reporters phone records reported spying even on Members of Congress and attempting to force small businesses to disclose their political affiliations before being considered for Federal contracts At what point Madam Speaker do we say enough is enough  I would remind all of us of the pleading words of Daniel Webster to all Americans when he said       Hold on my friends to the Constitution and to the      Republic for which it stands for miracles do not cluster      and what has happened once in 6000 years may never happen      again So hold on to the Constitution for if the American      Constitution should fall there will be anarchy throughout      the world  Madam Speaker the Faithful Execution of the Law Act is one very important step in the right direction This bill will help prevent executive overreach and require greater disclosure when it does occur  I want to thank Congressman DeSantis for bringing this legislation forward I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte for his steadfast leadership on bringing this administrations executive overreach to light and I would urge my colleagues to support this bill  I reserve the balance of my time
