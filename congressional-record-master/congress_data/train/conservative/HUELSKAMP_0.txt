 Thank you Congresswoman It is a pleasure and honor to join you tonight I will keep my comments short  You have heard the words here tonight You have heard the words religion tax You have heard the words religious litmus test You certainly heard the words religious liberty Of course we also heard that the principles of the First Amendment have to do with religious liberty and religious freedom  I was on the floor the day after the Supreme Court decision on the Presidents health care law and I would like to issue a challenge to what is generally considered the swing vote of this current court the Chief Justice himself  When I spoke about this issue court challenges were already coming forward on this HHS mandate but knowing that the Chief Justice is a Roman Catholic I issue a strong challenge to the Chief Justice  Given the history of the Catholic Church in this country it has been one of severe discrimination at times I would ask the Chief Justicethe deciding voteto consider his core convictions I believe he bears a particular burden to protect the religious liberties of employers and their employees from the excesses of his very own constitutional creation  The court asked to be in the middle of this position They asked for the government to have the right to tell businesses what to do whether for profit or nonprofit or businesses or nonbusinesses as well  What is at stake here is not the choice of businesses alone What is at stake here is not necessarily what the government can tell selected entities At stake is our Constitution and our rights and freedoms as Americans  We were founded on the issue of religious freedom and liberty from our very beginning Tomorrow I stand with the businesses the nonbusinesses and the private entities as well
