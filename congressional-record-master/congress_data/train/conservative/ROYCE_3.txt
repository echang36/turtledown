 Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume  When we are speaking of this issue I think Members should reflect that we are speaking of an Israel that faces from a regime in Iran that actually speaks of wiping Israel off of the map a regime in Iran that seeks to acquire a nuclear weapons capability and the missiles to deliver nuclear weapons a regime in Iran that has a proxy called Hezbollah  I remember a Deputy Secretary of State calling that organization the A team of terrorism in the world Hezbollah Hezbollah is greatly expanding its size and its influence and it is doing so not only in Lebanon but in Syria which neighbors Israel It is an organization that has probably some 70000 rockets by now that are aimed at Israels population centers We think of an Israel challenged by the proliferation of al Qaedaaffiliated organizations throughout that region We think of the ongoing threats from Hamas to the south and the Palestinian Islamic jihad  Those are severe challenges but Israel never has been as strong as it is now Think of Israels dynamic entrepreneurial culture there For those who have been to Tel Aviv it is inspiringit is unbelievablethe entrepreneurial spirit the innovative culture You get a better sense of why Israel is so strong but also a sense of why the bond between the United States and Israel is so great It is that dynamic economy and society that are building blocks for Israels qualitative military edge and its relationship with the United States  The benefits that we get from USIsrael relationships like the development of the Iron Dome is very strong I think that was probably built for 10 percent the price or cost and now all of our allies are interested in acquiring that Iron Dome and at the same time when you think about the Iron Dome you think of something that we in the United States thought was impossible to develop but in Israel engineers did so  Mr Speaker this legislation today stands by our values it stands by our interests and it stands by our ally Israel It is legislation all Members of the House should support  Seeing no additional speakers I yield back the balance of my time
