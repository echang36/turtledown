 Mr Speaker I rise today in support of HR 4152 which provides loan guarantees for Ukraine I am deeply concerned about the crisis in Ukraine Vladimir Putin is clearly the aggressor but the United States and our European allies have not done enough to support freedom self determination and human rights in Ukraine When America does not provide strong and reliable leadership bad things are more likely to happen  Unfortunately President Obamas foreign policy of leading from behind is a failure Even the liberal Washington Post this week said that President Obamas foreign policy is based on fantasy  We in Congress must do all we can to restore missing American leadership on foreign policy and that starts with Ukraine  The people of Ukraine should not be pawns in Vladimir Putins hands We must stand with our European and our other allies and do all we can to support freedom self determination and human rights in Ukraine I ask my colleagues to support HR 4152
