 I yield myself such time as I may consume  Mr Speaker part of our problem here is with President Putins definition of what is the Russian Nation in his speech to the Duma When he says the Russian Nation is divided by borders he is sending a message that with respect not just to Crimea but other areas throughout Europe Russia may be staking a claim  Here is the difficulty In Crimea yes the population today is majority ethnic Russian but there was a time when before Joe Stalin moved a wide segment of the Tatars population into Siberia and before the forced collectivization there was a time when the majority population was very different than it is today Fiftysix percent of that ethnic group perished But this is a problem that we also have in Eastern Europe and in eastern and southern Ukraine because you had some 8 million Ukrainians also perish during Stalins rule and ethnic Russians came into that area as a consequence  The thing we need to remember is that it is in fact the Russianspeaking population in the east as well as the Ukrainians speaking in the west that voted for independence for Ukraine that voted strongly to have a separate state And if this issue is allowed to stand without the world responding the question is Is that argument then made in Latvia and Estonia Is that argument then made in Latvia and Estonia Is that argument made in all of the former Russian states  I do not think in any way this is comparable to Kosovo In Kosovo NATO responded to a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing by former Yugoslavian forces In Crimea Russia attempted to justify its actions by fabricating the myth of widespread violence against the ethnic Russian population even going as far as to equate it to the bloodshed occurring in Syria Clearly this is not true We know it is not true  In terms of the election itself opponents were silenced International monitors were barred Crimean Tatars themselves boycotted the very election Voters were not given the option of preserving Crimeas current status within Ukraine Independence and de facto independence were the only options and the bogus vote there was also unnecessary because the Ukrainian Government had made it clear that it was willing to discuss increased autonomy for Crimea  Now here is the problem going forward We know the view taken internationally on this subject The UN Security Council condemned Russias unprovoked aggression against Ukraine and Russia stood alonestood absolutely alone in this casebecause even Ukrainians themselves have gone to the sites of the Russian mediareported attacks against ethnic Russian minorities to show that that is not occurring That is in fact propaganda We cant let this stand  One of the other things we are doing in this bill is improving our broadcasting into Ukraine and the region to dispel these myths and spread the truth about the situation there  So I reserve the balance of my time
