 Mr Speaker as the House takes up the topic of executive overreach this week we should take a minute to note that this issue is institutional not partisan  In a recent LA Times column Jonathan Turley after acknowledging that he agreed with many of the policies of the current administration went on to say       In our system it is often more important how we do      something than what we do Priorities and policies and      Presidents change Democrats will rue the day of their      acquiescence to this shift of power when a future President      negates an environmental law or an antidiscrimination law      or tax laws  The separation of political power among three equal branches was designed to guard against too much power accumulating in the hands of any one person or branch This system is one of the main reasons our government has endured for nearly a quarter of a millennium  We should not cast it aside lightly
