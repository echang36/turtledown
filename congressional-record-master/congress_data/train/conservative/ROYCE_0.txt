 Mr Speaker I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me I also thank the gentlewoman from Florida Ms RosLehtinen our chairman emeritus and the gentleman from New York Mr Engel the ranking member for their working together to craft this bipartisan resolution a resolution that is focused on supporting Venezuelans supporting their right to free expression their right to democracy their right for those who yearn to return to the rule of law and frankly not just democratic norms but just the most basic respect for human beings  In recent weeks Venezuela has been rocked by nationwide protests against the government of the late Hugo Chavezs handpicked successor Nicolas Maduro I as I watched events unfold on CNN they began as student protests Students were going through the streets explaining that they were against rampant street crime and they wanted the protections of the state rather than the predatory nature of what was happening with these armed gangs Those protests have since evolved into a referendum on the governments statist policies their destructive economic policies the governments near elimination of civil societys freedoms in Venezuela  Maduros heavyhanded response frankly I think all of us see this now as having really worsened this crisis We are in a situation now where more than a dozen Venezuelans have been killed and many students have been grievously wounded Even more than that have been jailed The leading opposition figure right now is in prison  These parliamentary gangs that we talked about that are so predatory that roam the streets and commit these crimes now they threaten civilians who are trying to peacefully express opposition The President of the country has threatened to release in his words all of the military force of the country against those who oppose him against the opposition Even one sitting governor who had long allied himself with Hugo Chavez was driven to say that the government has gone too far He took to the radio and said       I am against putting down a peaceful protest with weapons  Precisely Preciselyand that of course is why the international community is concerned and we are concerned here today  All of this of course is taking place in our own Western Hemisphere just a 3hour flight from the United States As a major energy producer positioned along drug trafficking routes Venezuelas instability harms the interests of all in the Western Hemisphere  Venezuela once had a strong democratic tradition We would like to see that democratic tradition returned We think the right of free expression is an important human right Speaking out in support of those who share this vision as we are doing today I think is an important step in realizing that goal and that is why I again commend Chairman RosLehtinen and Ranking Member Engel for this resolution that they have brought forward
