 Mr Speaker tonight the Statesville Chamber of Commerce will host its annual dinner and recognize the individuals businesses and nonprofits that help make Statesville North Carolina thrive  Unfortunately our work here will keep me from joining them As we recognize the great work local organizations like the Statesville Chamber do to help local businesses compete we should remain focused on the task of keeping Washington out of their way  We have passed numerous bills in the House to cut through bureaucracy and get the government out of the way of job creators  In the last week of February the House passed one such bill the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act UMITA would require new Federal rules and regulations to undergo more complete and accurate cost analyses  With regulations estimated to impose over 87 million hours of paperwork on American businesses I hope this bill passes the Senate with the same bipartisan support it received in the House
